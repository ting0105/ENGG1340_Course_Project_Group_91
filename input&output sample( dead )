Welcome to Call of Cthulhu (CoC)!!!
Now, you need to create your own investigator.
You can distribute the attribute point to different characteristics which will affect your playing style.
Your total attribute points will be determined by eight 3D6 die roll, and that number multiplied by 5.
Die roll 1: You rolled 3 + 6 + 5 = 14
Die roll 2: You rolled 6 + 4 + 5 = 15
Die roll 3: You rolled 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
Die roll 4: You rolled 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Die roll 5: You rolled 5 + 3 + 6 = 14
Die roll 6: You rolled 3 + 6 + 1 = 10
Die roll 7: You rolled 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
Die roll 8: You rolled 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
Your total attribute points is 88 * 5 = 440

Now you can distribute your points.
You can use command [attribute name] [value] to distribute your points.
For example, the command "STR 50" will add 50 points to STR (strength)
You may put minimum 15 points and maximum 90 points in each attribute except HP and SAN.
It is because the value of HP is depended on SIZ and CON, while SAN is depended on POW.
HP = (SIZ + CON) / 10 and SAN = POW
Use the command "reset" if you wish to reset all attribute points.
Use the command "random" if you wish to distribute the remaining points randomly

Your current stats :
STR (strength)     :0
CON (constitution) :0
POW (willpower)    :0
DEX (Dexterity)    :0
APP (appearance)   :0
SIZ (size)         :0
INT (intelligence) :0
LUC (luck)         :0

HP  (Hit Points)   :0
SAN (Sanity)       :0
Points left: 440
random

Your current stats :
STR (strength)     :76
CON (constitution) :18
POW (willpower)    :62
DEX (Dexterity)    :22
APP (appearance)   :16
SIZ (size)         :90
INT (intelligence) :76
LUC (luck)         :80

HP  (Hit Points)   :10
SAN (Sanity)       :62
You have distributed all your attribute points.
use command "confirm" to finish character creation or use command "reset" to reset.
**Once you confirmed, you cannot change the characteristics until the end of the game or the death of your investigator.**

**The game will be auto saved when you enter a room**

In the mist, under the darkness, you see a figure in yellow, standing afar, staring at you.
Your eyes scan through the figure, as your sight stopped on his face, you did not see anything,
but a chill strikes your spine, from the very bottom, up till the back of your head,
it is the emotion of fear, the feeling of certain death, and the desire to run.
And so did you, you started running, running into the abyss, as the darkness slowly engulfs you, swallowing you whole.

S5
25th August 1993
After weeks of investigation, we’ve successfully located the coordinates of the ruins.
It’s only a matter of time for us to fully unfold the truth.

2nd November 1993
Unbelievable... we’ve found it, the ruin is more than two kilometers buried into the earth…
It is impossible for humans to build structure in such scale in this depth.
The ruin is old, it’s created even before the start of mankind…

5th November 1993
It has been three days into exploration,
but as we go further and deeper, this ruin only seems to be expanding endlessly…
We’ve suffered personnel losses, over the course of three days,
seven had vanished, it’s not going to be long until people start losing their mind from stress.

13th November 1993
We’ve found something noticeable, in the center of a large hall, a coffin,
but the coffin seems to be locked by some mechanism, my assistant is now working.

20th November 1993
I’ve been in coma for a week since we encountered that… that humanoid thing.
It killed half of the team within the blink of a eye…
We are lucky to even be here, and miraculously, it fell unconscious, for some unknown reason.
Suffered from major loss, we are now evacuating with our captured subject.

5th December 1993
It has been two weeks after we’ve arrived back to our facility, but that thing is still unconscious…

7th December 1993
That thing woke up, but did not appears to be aggressive, we are still uncertain of its identity and awareness.

21st January 1994
A researcher responsible for feeding
and mental assessment had been discovered to be showing sympathy and is obsessed with its humanoid appearance.
I ordered to execute him. The council did not approve this.

23rd January 1994
The subject had demonstrated emotion of concern and trepidation after the executed researcher was removed from the laboratory.

8th September 2008
We’ve discovered crucial clues that can help us identify the subject with an important artifact the expedition team found in the ruin…
It’s been 15 years for another icebreaking discovery…
